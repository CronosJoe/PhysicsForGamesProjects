Obstacle Ideas:
Swinging obstacles that would knock the players off the track
A fan or something to bring in trigger collision to push the player towards stuff, these might need to have a player interaction to make interesting
a spring pad to showw off hooks law or something
Something for ragdoll? Enemy? Hand controller?
